# FFLocker

**FFLocker** (File Folder Locker) is a military-grade .NET console application that provides cryptographic "locking" of directories by encrypting files and obfuscating both file and folder names. It features advanced streaming encryption for unlimited file sizes, triple-redundant metadata storage, and parallel processing for optimal performance and reliability.

## Features

### üîí **Security**
* **AES-256-GCM encryption**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption providing both confidentiality and integrity
* **Enhanced key derivation**: 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations with SHA-256 for maximum GPU attack resistance
* **Per-file unique salts**: Each file uses a cryptographically unique salt for perfect forward secrecy
* **Per-file keys**: Each file uses a unique key derived from the master key via HMAC-SHA256
* **Cryptographic nonces**: Unique 96-bit nonces per chunk prevent replay attacks
* **Tamper detection**: Any modification to encrypted files is automatically detected and rejected

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**
* **Triple-redundant metadata**: Primary, backup, and recovery containers ensure no single point of failure
* **Atomic operations**: All file operations are atomic to prevent corruption during interruption
* **Automatic fallback**: If primary metadata fails, automatically tries backup and recovery containers

```

### What Happens During Operations

**During lock:**
- Enter your password when prompted
- All files are encrypted using streaming AES-256-GCM with unique salts
- Files get cryptographically secure random `.ffl` names
- Directories are obfuscated with secure random names
- Original files/folders are securely deleted with random overwriting
- Three metadata containers are created for maximum reliability

**During unlock:**
- Enter the same password used for locking
- System attempts to load primary metadata container, with automatic fallback to backup/recovery
- Directory structure is restored first (shallow to deep)
- Files are decrypted back to original locations using streaming
- All obfuscated files and metadata containers are cleaned up

## How It Works

### Streaming Architecture

FFLocker uses a **streaming encryption model** that provides several key advantages:

1. **Constant Memory Usage**: Only 1MB RAM used regardless of file size
2. **Unlimited File Sizes**: Can handle TB-scale files without issues
3. **Chunk-Based Processing**: Files processed in 1MB chunks with unique nonces
4. **Parallel Safety**: Multiple large files can be processed simultaneously

```
File ‚Üí 1MB Chunks ‚Üí Per-Chunk Encryption ‚Üí Secure Random .ffl Output
[Chunk 1: Nonce‚ÇÅ + AES-GCM‚ÇÅ + Tag‚ÇÅ]
[Chunk 2: Nonce‚ÇÇ + AES-GCM‚ÇÇ + Tag‚ÇÇ]
[Chunk N: NonceN + AES-GCMN + TagN]
```

### Triple-Redundant Metadata System

FFLocker uses a proven dual-redundant approach similar to VeraCrypt's header backup system:

```
.fflmeta    (Primary metadata container)
.fflbkup    (Backup metadata container)  
.fflrcvr    (Recovery metadata container)
```

**Benefits:**
- **No single point of failure**: If one container is corrupted, others provide recovery
- **Automatic fallback**: System tries primary ‚Üí backup ‚Üí recovery automatically
- **Proven reliability**: Based on established encryption tool architectures
- **Integrity verification**: Each container includes verification hashes

### Security Model

1. **Master Key Derivation**: `PBKDF2(password + global_salt, 600,000 iterations) ‚Üí 256-bit key`
2. **Per-File Salts**: Each file gets a unique 256-bit cryptographic salt
3. **Per-File Keys**: `HMAC-SHA256(master_key, file_path + file_salt) ‚Üí unique 256-bit key`
4. **Chunk Nonces**: Each chunk gets a cryptographically secure random 96-bit nonce
5. **Authentication**: Each chunk authenticated with 128-bit GCM tag

## Technical Specifications

### File Format

**Encrypted File Structure:**
```
Header: [FileSize]

```

### Metadata Container Format

# FFLocker Dual-Redundant Metadata Container
# Container Type: Primary/Backup/Recovery
# Created: [timestamp] UTC

```

### Cryptographic Parameters
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256, 600,000 iterations (GPU-resistant)
- **Nonce Size**: 96 bits (cryptographically secure random per chunk)
- **Authentication Tag**: 128 bits per chunk
- **Global Salt**: 256 bits (random per operation)
- **Per-File Salt**: 256 bits (unique per file)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Usage**: Constant 1MB per file operation
- **Parallelism**: Auto-adjusted based on file sizes and system resources

- **Encryption Ratio**: 100% - all data is fully encrypted

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- **Use strong passwords**: High entropy recommended (16+ characters)
- **No password recovery**: Lost passwords mean permanent data loss
- **Enhanced brute force protection**: 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations significantly increases attack cost

### Cryptographic Strength
- **NIST-approved algorithms**: AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Unique keys and salts per file
- **Authenticated encryption**: Prevents tampering and forgery
- **Cryptographic randomness**: Hardware-based random number generation
- **GPU attack resistance**: Enhanced iteration count protects against specialized hardware

### Threat Model
- ‚úÖ **Protects against**: File system access, data theft, forensic analysis
- ‚úÖ **Detects tampering**: Any file modification breaks authentication
- ‚úÖ **Prevents single points of failure**: Triple-redundant metadata recovery
- ‚úÖ **Resists GPU attacks**: Enhanced key derivation parameters
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does not protect against**: Memory analysis while unlocked, keyloggers, coercion

### Security Features
- **Triple-redundant recovery**: Multiple metadata containers prevent data loss
- **Atomic operations**: Prevents corruption during interruption
- **Secure deletion**: Original files overwritten with random data before deletion
- **No metadata leakage**: No identifying signatures or plaintext headers

## Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Windows only**: Uses Windows-specific AesGcm implementation
- **Password dependent**: No password recovery mechanism available
- **File system locks**: Cannot encrypt files currently in use by other applications
- **Sequential directory operations**: Directory moves not parallelized for filesystem safety

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform dependency**: Requires Windows CNG for AES-GCM
- **Antivirus interference**: May be flagged due to encryption behavior
- **Network drive performance**: Reduced speeds on network storage
- **Large dataset time**: Very large datasets still require significant processing time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

1. **Test with non-critical data first** - Always verify functionality before use
2. **Maintain secure backups** - Lost passwords result in permanent data loss
3. **Antivirus exclusions** - May need to exclude FFLocker from real-time scanning
4. **Avoid interruption** - Do not interrupt locking/unlocking operations
5. **Verify integrity** - Always verify unlocked data before deleting encrypted copies
6. **Strong passwords** - Use high-entropy passwords with mix of characters

## Performance Notes

FFLocker is optimized for:
- **SSD storage**: Best performance on solid-state drives
- **Modern CPUs**: Utilizes AES-NI instructions when available
- **Adequate RAM**: Minimal memory requirements (1MB per file operation)
- **Fast storage**: Network drives and slow storage will reduce throughput

For optimal performance:
- Use SSDs for both source and temporary storage
- Ensure adequate free disk space (2x dataset size during encryption)
- Close unnecessary applications to free up CPU cores
- Ensure antivirus exclusions are configured properly

**Remember: FFLocker provides military-grade encryption for sensitive data. Use responsibly and always maintain secure backups of important files.
In the end your password determines the strength of this program**
